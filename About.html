    <h2>About Website</h2>
    <p>Hello students , We have made this website for your convenience.

    Playing flash games to refresh your mind, Reading current affairs, Learning
    new things, Information about sports and watching live sports, This website
    also helps in your school projects, You can also watch your favourite cartoon
    shows and movies. This website also gives you lot of information about Thesaurus, Dictionary
    and Atlas.</p>
    <p>Don't think that we childrens and students are weak. If we have desire to do
    something big the first thought that comes in our mind is that we are small and
    some think that they are weak. First we should remove these thoughts from our
    mind. If we have will power to do anything we will definately be successful in
    doing that. There are many examples like Former President of INDIA A.P.J ABDUL KALAM
    who dreamt to be a aeronautical engineer and wanted to fly like a bird and finally
    he achieved that, and the great THOMAS ALVA EDISON who was not that good in
    his academics and was driven out of his school, but he did not lose his hope , he
    then worked hard and lightened the whole world. So there are many examples...</p>
    <p>Don't think that this website that you are using is made by elders or any other
    Web Developers. Even we are students just like you guys. We made this website using
    basic HTML Programming. This website is done by Five students as a team.</p>
